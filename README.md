CHARACTERISTICS OF WEB 3

1. It's a semantic web, where the web technology evolves into a tool that lets users create, share, and connect content via search and analysis. It is based on comprehension of words instead of numbers and keywords.

2. It presents the connectivity of multiple devices and applications through the Internet of Things (IoT). Semantic metadata makes this process possible, allowing all available information to be effectively leveraged. In addition, people can connect to the Internet anytime, anywhere, without needing a computer or smart device.

3.It offers users the freedom to interact publicly or privately without having an intermediary expose them to risks, therefore offering people “trustless” data

4. It facilitates participation without needing authorization from a governing body. It’s permissionless.

5. It can be used for:

Metaverses: A 3D-rendered, boundless, virtual world

Blockchain games: They allow users to have actual ownership of in-game resources, following the principles of NFTs

Decentralized finance: This use includes payment Blockchains, peer-to-peer digital financial transactions, smart contracts, and cryptocurrency.

6. It incorporates Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. If these concepts are combined with Natural Language Processing (NLP), the result is a computer that uses Web 3.0 to become smarter and more responsive to user needs
